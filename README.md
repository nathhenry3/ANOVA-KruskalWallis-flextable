# ANOVA-KruskalWallis-flextable
Just for personal reference - some functions to simplify creating flextables for multiple one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis comparisons

Contains functions demographise() and demographise_anova(), plus examples of creating those tables. 

Will need to add a .RProj file to get here::here() calls to work
